# CeramicPrinter_Marlin_REPRAP_DISCOUNT_SMART_CONTROLLER
Marlin arduino firmware for 'Make your own Ceramic 3D Printer with a REPRAP_DISCOUNT_SMART_CONTROLLER

Note: This version of the Make your own Ceramic Delta 3D Printer Marlin firmware is set up for a REPRAP_DISCOUNT_SMART_CONTROLLER LCD screen. This version of Marlin will also need an old version of Arduino - I use version 1.0.5.
