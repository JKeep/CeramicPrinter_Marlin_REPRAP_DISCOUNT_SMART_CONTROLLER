# CeramicPrinter_Marlin_REPRAP_DISCOUNT_SMART_CONTROLLER
Marlin arduino firmware for 'Make your own Ceramic 3D Printer with a REPRAP_DISCOUNT_SMART_CONTROLLER

Note: This version of the Make your own Ceramic Delta 3D Printer Marlin firmware is set up for a REPRAP_DISCOUNT_SMART_CONTROLLER LCD screen. This version of Marlin will also need an old version of Arduino to compile in - I use version 1.0.5. 
Also make sure the name of your Marlin Folder is the same name as your .ino Arduino file in the folder. (Downloading the zip from github appears to put a 'Master' on the folder name)
